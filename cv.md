## Summary

I have been working at QA at IUS (Intelligent Urban Systems) since February 2019. I have written some autotests in Python. On projects in our company, I am the only tester, so I know what self-training is. In my free time, I tried to make up the pages and realized that I like to create something much more than something to "break" and check, so I decided to try myself in the role of Front-end developer and I believe that I will succeed.
